# Kubernetes Manifests for Node.js App ðŸš€
## Overview
This repo contains Kustomize-based Kubernetes manifests for dev and prod environments.

## Features

- Separate overlays for dev and prod.

- Integration with Argo CD for GitOps deployment.

- Automated updates to image tags from the app repo.

## Project Structure

  deployment.yaml
  service.yaml

```
## How it works

Argo CD watches this repo and syncs changes automatically.

When image tags are updated by the CI pipeline, Argo CD deploys new versions.
